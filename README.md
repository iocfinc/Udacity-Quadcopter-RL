# Udacity-Quadcopter-RL

## Background

This project was created as part of the requirements for Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree. This is the project for the Deep Reinforcement module of the course.

The method implemented in this project is Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). The task I have selected for the quadcopter to perform was to move from one location to the second location and hover on that location. This was tested in a physics simulator already pre-built by the Udacity team. What I added was the architecture of the DDPG for the agent, defined the task for the agent and created the reward equation for the quadcopter's control.
